Looking for a front end developer with both the passion and training for accessible software? Look no further!

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Allison! I am a graduate of UNC's School of Information and Library Science, where I earned my MS in Human-Computer Interaction. Before that, I worked as a database specialist at NC State, a bookseller at my hometown indie, and a radio producer/web content developer at my hometown community radio station. I love making things make sense. Outside of work, I enjoy dogs, Americana music, creative nonfiction and cultural criticism, weaving, fiber arts, gardening, and cooking with my partner.
