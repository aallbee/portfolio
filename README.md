Looking for a human-understander researcher with both the passion and training for accessible information solutions? Look no further.

Hi 👋 I'm Allison! I am a graduate of UNC's School of Information and Library Science, where I earned my MS in Human-Computer Interaction. Before that, I worked as a database specialist at NC State, an independent bookseller, and a radio producer/web content developer at my hometown community radio station. I love making things make sense. Outside of work - I enjoy dogs, Americana music, creative nonfiction and cultural criticism, weaving, fiber arts, gardening, and cooking with my partner. Drop me a line!
